##  Study Notes

######  This documentation is meant as study notes that compiled from my experiences of implementing this project, so that I can keep things more organized and make it a more meaningful learning experience

* This personal project is inspired by this amazing piece of material https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki. It serves the purpose for me to study computer graphics out of my strong interest in the discipline.

* I try to implement a software renderer from scratch following this material while not fully depending on the provided source code, since I want to struggle through the details to learn. Therefore, my implementation is probably crappy and far from optimal. If I do get stuck for a long time at some point, I would look for some hints from the material and source code.

######  Line Drawing

* My crappy implementation
  * Naively interpret the math of Bresenham's line drawing to C++, which is a lot slower than the version provided in "tinyrenderer"
